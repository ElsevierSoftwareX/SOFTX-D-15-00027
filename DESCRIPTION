Title: Package for graphical aid in Correspondence Analysis interpretation and
    significance testing
Version: 0.4
Authors@R: "Gianmarco ALberti <gianmarcoalberti@tin.it> [aut, cre]"
Description: A number of interesting packages are available to perform
    Correspondence Analysis in R. At the best of my knowledge, they lack some
    tools to help users to eyeball some critical CA aspects (e.g., contribution
    of rows/cols categories to the principal axes, quality of the display,
    correlation of rows/cols categories with dimensions, etc). Besides
    providing those facilities, this package allows the users to calculate the
    significance of the CA dimensions by means of the 'Average Rule', the
    Malinvaud test, and by permutation test. Further, it allows to also
    calculate the permuted significance of the CA total intertia. NOTE: dataset
    to be fed into the package's functions must be a dataframe.
